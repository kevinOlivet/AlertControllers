AlertCustomBlur

This project implements a custom alert using a blurry pop up animation with UIVisualEffects.

It creates a simple popup animation that also blurs the background with an animated UIVisualEffectView. 

Simply tap the + button in the navigationBar to see it in effect.
Keep in mind that due to the limits of the simulator it will look much smoother on a real device.
