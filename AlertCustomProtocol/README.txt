AlertCustomProtocol

This project uses a protocol called Modal to programmatically present a custom alertController.
It's a subclass of UIView and adopts my Modal protocol.
Most interesting for me is that the functionality of presenting is in the Modal extension.
I've been interested in how Protocol Oriented Programming would work and this is a good example.
